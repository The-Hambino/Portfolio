				<h1>4 Games to Enjoy with Windows 10 in 2015</h1>
				<p class="article_author">Nicholas Scibetta</p>
				<p>Windows 10 is coming to PCs (along with other devices) on July 29, which means you'll have plenty of time to complete your free upgrade in time for the back-to-school and holiday gaming releases. Windows 10 is packed with a suite of gaming-focused enhancements, not the least of which is support for DirectX 12, which we should see released late in 2015.</p>
				<p>Let's take a look ahead at the PC games you'll be playing on your newly-upgraded OS later this year.</p>
				<img class="article_img" src="img/article-fourGames-02.jpg" border="0" />
				<h2>Fable Legends</h2>
				<p>The Fable series has been a cornerstone of Microsoft's gaming world since the first title hit the Xbox back in 2004, Traditionally the Fable games have been action RPGs notable for their morality systems and meaningful interactions with NPCs, but Fable Legends is taking the series in a whole new direction. Legends will be a free-to-play, 4 vs. 1 battle game set in the world of Albion, in which a team of four fantasy heroes moves through a map populated by enemies, traps, and obstacles controlled by a villain player.</p>
				<p>Legends takes the co-op experience present in some of the previous Fable games to a new level, making it the core of the gameplay experience. Best of all, Fable Legends is one of the first titles which will support cross-play between PC and Xbox One systems, which should make it easier than ever before to team up with your friends for some 4 vs. 1 action.</p>
				<p>Fable Legends is expected to be released later in 2015. For more, read GameCrate's hands-on preview.</p>
				<img class="article_img" src="img/article-fourGames-03.jpg" border="0" />
				<h2>Gigantic</h2>
				<p>Speaking of cross-play, that's also one of the interesting features present in this sort-of-MOBA from developers Motiga. Gigantic is another free-to-play multiplayer title, this time pitting two teams of five colorful and diverse characters against one another in a battle to defeat the other team's giant guardians.</p>
				<p>The characters in Gigantic range from snipers to robots to kung-fu frog men, and support a wide variety of different play-styles. In much the same way as popular titles like League of Legends and Dota 2, players level up their heroes over the course of a match, unlocking different abilities and pushing forward across the map as they try to lead their teams to victory.</p>
				<p>Gigantic will allow players to opt-in to cross-play between PC and Xbox One if they choose when it releases in the fall. For more details on Gigantic and its relationship with Microsoft and Windows 10, check out GameCrate's interview with Motiga's Senior Vice President of Publishing David Reid.</p>

				<h2>Call of Duty: Black Ops III</h2>
				<p>Every gamer knows Call of Duty, and this November fans will get their hands on the latest installment of the franchise. Black Ops III continues the Black Ops line of Call of Duty games developed by Treyarch, so you'll want to check it out if you've enjoyed previous Black Ops games.</p>
				<p>We don't know much about Black Ops III just yet, but we do know that it's coming on November 6, 2015, and according to its reveal trailer it will be bringing robots with it. If you're a fan of sci-fi-infused military shooters, keep your eyes on Black Ops III as we get closer to its release date.</p>
				<img class="article_img" src="img/article-fourGames-05.jpg" border="0" />
				<h2>Star Wars Battlefront</h2>
				<p>PC gamers have fond memories of great Star Wars games of the past, and early looks at 2015's Star Wars Battlefront are promising another great experience in this classic sci-fi world. Battlefront will feature large-scale battles pulled straight from the Star Wars films and throughout series lore, and will allow players to fight against and alongside figures like Boba Fett and Darth Vader.</p>
				<p>Battlefront looks like a game designed to create memorable moments, and if you're playing it on a Windows 10 PC it'll be easier than ever to share those moments with your friends. Since Windows 10 features game video capturing, editing, and sharing built-in, the highlights of your Battlefront matches can live on long after the battle is over.</p>
				<p>Star Wars Battlefront will be released on November 17, 2015. For more on what to expect from the game, check out GameCrate's preview.</p>
				<p>These titles are barely scratching the surface of the games which will be available in 2015 and beyond on Windows PCs. And of course the popular PC games you're currently enjoying should keep right on rolling with the new OS â€“ just remember to back up your saved games!</p>
